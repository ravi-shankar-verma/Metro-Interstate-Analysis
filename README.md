# Machine Learning Project (Metro Insterstate Traffic Volume)

## Overview
This project explores various regression machine learning models, starting from data preprocessing to model evaluation. The focus is on **Linear Regression** with an emphasis on feature reduction and **Tree-Based Regressions** to analyze and predict a dependent variable.

## Project Structure

1. **Preprocessing (`1. Preprocessing.ipynb`)**  
   - Data cleaning, handling missing values.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (`2. EDA.ipynb`)**  
   - Visualizing distributions, correlations, and key insights.  

3. **Linear Regression & A/B Testing (`3. Linear Regression (A/B Testing).ipynb`)**  
   - Feature Engineering,Implementing linear regression and conducting A/B testing, Polynomial Transformation.  

4. **Tree-Based Regressions (`4. Tree Based Regressions.ipynb`)**  
   - Training and evaluating Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.
